--------------------------
-  INSTALL for Cadence  -
------------------------

To install Cadence and its tools, simply run as usual:
$ make
$ [sudo] make install

You can also run the tools without installing them, by using instead:
$ make
$ python3 src/<tool>.py
(Replace '<tool>' by a proper name, in lowercase. Some distros may need to use 'python' here)

Packagers can make use of the 'PREFIX' and 'DESTDIR' variable during install, like this:
$ make install PREFIX=/usr DESTDIR=./test-dir


===== [BUILD] DEPENDENCIES =====
The required build dependencies are: [devel packages of these]
 - JACK
 - liblo
 - Gtk2
 - Qt4
 - PyQt4

Optional but recommended:
 - FluidSynth
 - LinuxSampler

On Debian and Ubuntu, use this command to install all dependencies:
$ sudo apt-get install libjack-dev liblo-dev libgtk2.0-dev libqt4-dev qt4-dev-tools python-qt4-dev pyqt4-dev-tools libfluidsynth-dev
(NOTE: linuxsampler is not packaged in either Debian or Ubuntu, but it's available in KXStudio)

To run all the apps/tools, you'll additionally need:
 - python3-dbus
 - python3-liblo
 - python3-rdflib

Optional but recommended:
 - a2jmidid
 - jack-capture

The 'Cadence' and 'Catia' apps rely on a jackdbus version to work properly (either JACK2 or JACK1 + DBus patch).
Claudia is a LADISH frontend, so it will obviously require LADISH to run.

The python version used is python3.
After install, the app/tools will still work on distros with python2 as default, without any additional work.


===== [RUNTIME] DEPENDENCIES =====
All tools require Python3 and Qt4, some of them work on Windows and Mac.
Here's the required run-time dependencies of each of the main tools:

---> Cadence
Recommends a2jmidid and jackdbus
Suggests pulseaudio

---> Catarina
No special requirements

---> Catia
Recommends a2jmidid and jackdbus

---> Claudia [Linux only]
Requires jackdbus and ladish
Recommends a2jmidid

---> Carla
Requires liblo and Gtk2
Recommends python3-rdflib (for LADSPA RDF support)

---> Carla-Control
Requires python3-liblo

---> JACK-Meter
No special requirements

---> XY-Controller
No special requirements
