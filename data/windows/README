# ---  README for Cadence - Windows build ---

Cadence is a set of tools useful for audio production.
It's being developed by falkTX, using Python3 and Qt4 (and some C++ where needed).

This is the Windows build of Cadence.
Not all tools can be compiled or are useful under Windows, so not all of them can be used.

For a complete and updated description of these tools, please check:
